# Report-It- Field Reporting System. 

> A full-stack reporting portal to **track user activity logs**, **manage reports**, and **monitor system usage** . Built with ❤️ using **Vite+React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **TailwindCSS**.

---


## 📝 What This Project Is

Report-It empowers field agents to document on-site visits with text, photos, and comments. Agents can:
- **Create** rich field reports, including photos of the location  
- **Browse & comment** on reports submitted by colleagues  
- **Track** their own submissions over time  

Meanwhile, managers and admins gain full visibility:
- **Managers** can view all reports and join the conversation  
- **Admins** can do everything a manager can, plus **approve/revoke** user access, **view detailed activity logs**, and **export** any subset of reports as XLSX  

This system brings real-time collaboration, auditability, and data export into one simple interface.

## ⚡ Optimizations / TODOs

- [ ] Implement **WebSocket** for real-time user status (instead of polling)
- [ ] Add **Pagination** for logs if there are 1000+ records
- [ ] Enable **Admin Analytics** (charts for user growth, activity spikes)
- [ ] Deploy to **Vercel** (Frontend) and **Render** or **Railway** (Backend)

## 🧹 Cleaning tip

If you ever feel like the frontend cache is acting funky during development:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```
(Trust me, it works like black magic.)
